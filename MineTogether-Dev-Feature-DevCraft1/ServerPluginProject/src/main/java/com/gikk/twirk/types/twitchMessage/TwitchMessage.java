/**An encapsulation of a message sent via Twitch chat. <br><br>
 *
 * A message can have many different structures, but since they are based on the
 * IRC protocol, they will have 1 to 5 different segments, each segment separated
 * with a space (the last segment, the actual message, may contain any amount of spaces).
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tag - This segment is not always present. It is Twitch's own specialized segment which contains data relevant
 * to the message in questing. Example of content is UserColor, Emotes and such. The order which elements appear in a Tag
 * is not guaranteed. A Tag always begins with a @
 * <li>Prefix - This segment usually contains knowledge about the sender of the message.
 * <li>Command - This segment usually specifies what command the message issued
 * <li>Target - This segment tells about whom the message is targeted at (a person, a channel)
 * <li>Content - This segment contains the actual text, intended for the receiver to read.
 * </ul>
 * In some cases, the message will contain less segments than 5. In that case that a segments
 * aren't present, their content will be empty.<br><br>
