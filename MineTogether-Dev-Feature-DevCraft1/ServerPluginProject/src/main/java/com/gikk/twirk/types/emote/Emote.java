 * <li>EmoteID - The numeric ID for the emote.
 * <li>Pattern - The emote's string pattern (Ex. 'Kappa')
 * <li>Indices - For each time an emote is present in a message, the emotes begin- and end index must be listed. Begin is inclusive, end is exclusive

 * <li>EmoteID = 25
 * <li>Pattern = Kappa
 * <li>Indices = (0,5), (15,20)
